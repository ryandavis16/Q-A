# Q-A
To make sure my code is functional and secure I rely a lot on testing. Writing unit tests in JUnit showed me if the methods worked like they should and also gave me a chance to see what happened when bad inputs were used. Doing this helped me feel confident that the program wouldnâ€™t break in simple or edge cases, and it also gave some protection against issues that could lead to bugs later.

I use the requirements to figure out what the user actually needs instead of just what I think should be built. For example, if the rule said a name or phone number had to be within a certain length, I wrote tests to check both valid and invalid values. That way the program reflected what the user expected, not just what I wanted to code.

When I design software, I like to break it into small pieces and build it up from there. In this course that meant separate services for contacts, tasks, and appointments. Working on one part at a time made the project easier to test and understand, but I also had to think about how each piece would connect with the others. Starting with a simple structure and then adding tests along the way made the design process smoother and gave me more confidence in the final project.
